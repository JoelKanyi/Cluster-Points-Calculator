    <string name="gradingd">Each KCSE subject is graded on the basis of a twelve-point scale, with 12 points being the highest score and 1 the lowest these grades are accompanied by an expanded grading system from A, A-, B+ to E. Grade boundaries are determined by an Awards committee composed of experts selected from the various levels within the education sector. The mean grade (which ranges from A to E and 7 to 84) is an average grade based on performance in the 7 subjects as stated in the KCSE certificate award Regulations while aggregate points (AGPT) indicate the total number of grade points based on the 7 subjects. NO MEAN GRADE appears if the candidate sits for less than 7 subjects or where one or more subjects are cancelled due to an examinationirregularity or where the entry requirements have not been met. The letter Z indicates that entry requirements have not been met.</string>
